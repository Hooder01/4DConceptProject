A vertex shader is a small program that processes each vertex of a 3D model. 
It transforms the vertex position from 3D space into screen space by applying transformations like scaling, rotation, and projection.

Key Points:

Input: Receives vertex position and other attributes.

Processing: Transforms the position using matrices (model, view, projection).

Output: Outputs the final position (gl_Position) to be drawn on the screen.

It's essential for rendering objects and defining their appearance in a 3D space.
